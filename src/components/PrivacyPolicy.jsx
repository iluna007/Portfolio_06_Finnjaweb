      <p>Google Web Fonts</p>
      <p>
        For uniform representation of fonts, this page uses web fonts provided
        by Google. When you open a page, your browser loads the required web
        fonts into your browser cache to display texts and fonts correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this purpose your browser has to establish a direct connection to
        Google servers. Google thus becomes aware that our web page was accessed
        via your IP address. The use of Google Web fonts is done in the interest
        of a uniform and attractive presentation of our website. This
        constitutes a justified interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your browser does not support web fonts, a standard font is used by
        your computer.
      </p>
      <p>
