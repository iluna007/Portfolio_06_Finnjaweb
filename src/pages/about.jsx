                Finnja Willner is not just a filmmaker, visual anthropologist,
                transdisciplinary artist, and somatic movement educator. She is
                a unique storyteller who weaves together various disciplines in
                her projects, creating a strong, poetic, and sensitive visual
                language in film and photography. Her aim is not just to capture
                life realities but to illuminate them in a way that is uniquely
                hers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finnja is a versatile artist. At times, she works as a one-woman
                crew, skilled in camera work, directing, editing, and
                production. But she also enjoys the collaborative process,
                bringing her unique perspective to a team and contributing to
                the collective vision.
              </p>
              <p>
                Aside from her artistic pursuits, Finnja creates audiovisual
                content for websites and exhibitions for a diverse clientele.
                She has designed and led a wide array of workshops on an
                international scale, delivering them with passion. Her work is a
                reflection of her values, with a strong foundation in political
                education, and she is a certified Social Justice and Diversity
                trainer.

                <strong>FILM AND SOMATICS</strong> For me, images are embodied
                and lived experiences. Profoundly poetic images are
                multisensory, can speak to us on both a sensory and emotional
                level and thus can deepen our relationship with the world.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>FILM AND RELATIONSHIPS</strong> Each documentary project
                is a unique encounter with another reality, another life story,
                and another universe. I approach each project with tenderness,
                and the trust of my protagonists is the greatest gift I have as
                a filmmaker.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>FILM AND DANCE</strong> How can the body initiate a
                continuous movement that resonates in the camera and leaves an
                imprint on the image? How can the camera become an extension of
                the body and create another dance between the filmmaker and the
                filmed?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>FILM AND EDUCATION</strong> How can we tell stories that
                contribute to a reshaping of our world? How can we break down
                oppressive narratives and make a diversity of perspectives
                visible and tangible?
