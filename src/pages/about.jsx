                Finnja Willner is a filmmaker, visual anthropologist,
                transdisciplinary artist and somatic movement educator with
                focus on dance. In her projects she interweaves the different
                disciplines she is moving in, creating a strong, poetic and
                sensitive visual language in film and photography. She captures
                different life realities with honesty and care and aims to build
                bridges through her artwork.
              </p>
              <p>
                At times, she works as a one-woman-crew, skilled in camera work,
                directing, editing and production. However, she also enjoys the
                collaborative process, bringing her unique perspective to a team
                and contributing to the collective vision.
              </p>
              <p>
                Next to her artistic work she creates audiovisual content for
                web and exhibitions for diverse clients. She has designed and
                facilitated a broad variety of workshops in international
                contexts which she teaches with passion. She works aligned with
                her values, has worked in political education for many years and
                is a certified Social Justice and Diversity trainer.

                <strong>FILM AND SOMATICS</strong> For me, images are embodied
                and lived experiences. Profoundly poetic images are
                multisensory, can speak to us on both a sensory and emotional
                level and thus can deepen our relationship with the world.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>FILM AND RELATIONSHIPS</strong> Each documentary project
                is a unique encounter with another reality, another life story,
                and another universe. I approach each project with tenderness,
                and the trust of my protagonists is the greatest gift I have as
                a filmmaker.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>FILM AND DANCE</strong> How can the body initiate a
                continuous movement that resonates in the camera and leaves an
                imprint on the image? How can the camera become an extension of
                the body and create another dance between the filmmaker and the
                filmed?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>FILM AND EDUCATION</strong> How can we tell stories that
                contribute to a reshaping of our world? How can we break down
                oppressive narratives and make a diversity of perspectives
                visible and tangible?
