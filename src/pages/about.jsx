							<p>
								Finnja Willner is a visual anthropologist, filmmaker and somatic
								movement educator with focus on dance. In her projects she
								interweaves the different disciplines she is moving in, creating
								a strong, poetic and sensitive visual language in film and
								photography. She captures different life realities with honesty
								and care and aims to build bridges through her artwork.
							</p>
							<p>
								At times, Finnja works as a one-woman-crew, skilled in camera
								work, directing, editing and production. However, she believes
								in the creative power of the collective. She enjoys the
								collaborative process, bringing her unique perspective to her
								team and contributing to the collective vision.
							</p>
							<p>
								Next to her artistic work, Finnja creates audiovisual content
								for web and exhibitions for diverse clients. She has designed
								and facilitated a broad variety of workshops in international
								contexts which she teaches with passion. She has worked in the
								field of anti-discrimination for many years and is a certified
								Social Justice and Diversity trainer.

								<strong>FILM AND SOMATICS</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								<i>
									For me, images are embodied and lived experiences. Profoundly
									poetic images are multisensory, can speak to us on both a
									sensory and emotional level and thus can deepen our
									relationship with the world.
								</i>
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>FILM AND RELATIONSHIPS</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								<i>
									Each documentary project is a unique encounter with another
									reality, another life story and another universe. I approach
									with tenderness and the trust of my protagonists is the
									greatest gift to me as a filmmaker.
								</i>
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>FILM AND DANCE</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								{" "}
								<i>
									How can the body initiate a continuous movement that resonates
									in the camera and leaves an imprint on the image? How can the
									camera become an extension of the body and create another
									dance between the filmmaker and the filmed?
								</i>
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>FILM AND EDUCATION</strong>
							</p>

							<p>
								{" "}
								<i>
									How can we tell stories that contribute to a reshaping of our
									world? How can we break down oppressive narratives and make a
									diversity of perspectives visible and tangible?
								</i>
