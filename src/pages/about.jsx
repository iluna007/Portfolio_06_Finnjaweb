                Finnja Willner is a filmmaker, visual anthropologist,

                In her projects she often interweaves the different disciplines
                she is moving in. She has a strong, poetic and sensitive visual
                language, both in film and photography, through which she aims
                to make different realities of life tangible. Sometimes she
                works as a one-woman-crew and is experienced in camera,
                directing, editing and production. But mainly she very much
                enjoys working in a team.
              </p>
              <p>
                Next to her artistic work she produces audiovisual web and
                exhibition content for different clients and has developed and
                facilitated a broad variety of workshops in an international
                context which she teaches with a lot of passion. She works
                aligned with her values, has worked in political education for
                many years and is a certified Social Justice and Diversity
                trainer.

                <strong>FILM AND SOMATICS</strong> For me, images are embodied
                and lived experiences. Profoundly poetic images are
                multisensory, can speak to us on both a sensory and emotional
                level and thus can deepen our relationship with the world.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>FILM AND RELATIONSHIPS</strong> Each documentary project
                is a unique encounter with another reality, another life story,
                and another universe. I approach each project with tenderness,
                and the trust of my protagonists is the greatest gift I have as
                a filmmaker.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>FILM AND DANCE</strong> How can the body initiate a
                continuous movement that resonates in the camera and leaves an
                imprint on the image? How can the camera become an extension of
                the body and create another dance between the filmmaker and the
                filmed?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>FILM AND EDUCATION</strong> How can we tell stories that
                contribute to a reshaping of our world? How can we break down
                oppressive narratives and make a diversity of perspectives
                visible and tangible?
