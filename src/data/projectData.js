      "Almond Cookies and Red Soil is a documentary film about the encounter with Doña Quiteria, Servilia and their companions - women from Garafía, a rural area on the Canary Island La Palma, who have spent a lifetime living on and working this land. The camera becomes a witness of their poetry and joy in baking cookies in an oven house full of stories. The women take us on a journey through time to a hidden oven in the canyons and share how life in the countryside has changed with the passing of the years. The film is accompanied by a small book with the stories about the encounters the artists made during their stay."

In this space, we propose to develop artistic practices (performative, installation, audiovisual, etc.) that question the relationship between the intimate and the public in order to subvert current notions of proximity and social distance. This collective initiative seeks to investigate in our bodies intimate spaces of resistance to isolation."

      "Menstruation moves between hype and taboo, from the shadows into public awareness. Periods are political because a direct experience is made more difficult due to history and socialization. The feminist collective Nerka is exploring the intersection of dance, performance, somatics and menstruation. During a research period they developed a choreography which since then has been in an ever changing movement - just like menstruation does. At the Performing Arts Festival they share the practice of re-appropriation in an interactive performance and invite the public to come into contact with their own cycle through a guided sensory vision."

    description:
      "In 2015 the first Cinetaya workshop was initiated by Finnja Willner and Evelina Winkler at the Foundation Casa Tres Mundos in Granada, Nicaragua. One of the guiding principles of their international film initiative is: ‘A country without documentary film is like a family without a photo album’ (Patricio Guzmán). With this in mind, the two german filmmakers realised two extensive workshops in the cultural center. The first took place from August to November 2015 and the follow-up workshop was held in September/October 2016. In addition to the theoretical knowledge transfer about all phases of documentary film production, the 15 participants were able to put the expertise they had learnt into practice. They slipped into the roles of film directors, screenwriters, cinematographers and film editors and collected stories of their hometown Granada and the everyday lives of its inhabitants. A series of successful short films were created during the workshops, which shared different life realities from their unique viewpoints. They were presented at the end of each course in the C3M auditorium. The subsequent audience discussion with the young directors provided an opportunity for an open exchange of experiences and opinions. The course was enriched by guest classes, additional screenings and director's talks held by Gabriel Serra (nominated for an Oscar in 2014) and British director Dominic Allan, among others.Since 2017 the workshops have been guided on by Stalin Ocampo, who also developed a web series with the new participants."

The participants presented their final works at a beautiful open air cinema night with music and public discussions in the local urban gardens. And continued making movies together after the end of the course."

With OFFscreen Media we documented 18 buildings designed by the studio and the short films were part of the exhibition."
