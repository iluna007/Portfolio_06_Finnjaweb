Dins d’aquella tassa de te que vam compartir, hi havia totes aquestes casualitats juntes i tot s’havia alineatperquè tu i jo, aquell matí, ens el beguéssim fent glopets. Mentre parlàvem sentíem el riu galopar, embarassat de peixos platejats i granotetes, recordàvem escenes del passat i en projectàvem de futures. A ulls de tothom, érem dues figures ben juntes prenent un te a la llera d’una gorga; però pels que hi veien més enllà, l’escena era molt més esplèndida. Assegudes, al nostre voltant, hi havia les nostres avantpassades, transparents i silencioses, carregades de vida, d’experiència, de secrets que havien arribat fins a nosaltres i de secrets que havien mort amb elles, i totes, sense fer soroll, s’apropaven i feien glopets d’aquella mateixa tassa, que no parava de fumejar.",

Inside that cup of tea we shared, all these coincidences met. And everything had aligned so that you and I, this particular morning, drank it in sips. As we talked, listening to the galloping river - pregnant with silver fish and frogs - we remembered scenes of the past and projected those of the future. To everyone's eyes, we were two figures sitting close to each other, sipping tea in a riverbed. But to those who saw beyond, the scene was more splendid. Seated around us were our ancestors, transparent and silent. Full of life. Of experience. Of secrets that had come to us and of secrets that had died with them. And they all, without a sound, approached and took small sips from that same cup, which kept on steaming.",

The first took place from August to November 2015 and the follow-up was held in September/October 2016. In addition to the theoretical knowledge transfer about all phases of documentary film production, the participants were able to put the expertise they had learnt into practice.
