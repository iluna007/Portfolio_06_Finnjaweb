With this in mind, the two filmmakers realised two extensive workshops in the cultural center. The first took place from August to November 2015 and the follow-up was held in September/October 2016. In addition to the theoretical knowledge transfer about all phases of documentary film production, the participants were able to put the expertise they had learnt into practice. They slipped into the roles of film directors, screenwriters, cinematographers and film editors and collected stories of their hometown Granada and the everyday lives of its inhabitants.'

The course was enriched by guest classes, additional screenings and director's talks held by Gabriel Serra (nominated for an Oscar in 2014) and British director Dominic Allan, among others."

Together with her German filmpartner Finnja, Katti flies to Seoul to ask, why do Koreans appreciate poop? Where is the small face obsession coming from? What do the sex shelters show us about society? They find a poop philosopher, face shrinking massages and home making machines. Deep inside Korea, Katti longs to build a second home there while Finnja questions her own home idea.'
